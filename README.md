# Coding_Raja_task_3_FlightPrediction
## Indian Flight Price Prediction

This project is focused on utilizing machine learning techniques and hyperparameter tuning to predict flight prices. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict price based on various features such as route, duration, stops, and more.


### Background
Flight delays can cause significant inconvenience and frustration for travelers. By predicting flight delays accurately, we can help passengers make more informed decisions and potentially mitigate the impact of delays. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques and hyperparameter tuning to develop a robust model for flight prediction.

### Installation
To run this project locally, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

* Python (version 3.7 or higher)
* Jupyter Notebook
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* Numpy

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found in the data directory. It contains historical flight data including features such as origin airport, destination airport, scheduled departure time, actual departure time, total stops, and more. The target variable is the flight price status.

Model Training
The flight_prediction.ipynb notebook contains the code for preprocessing the dataset, training the machine learning model, and saving the trained model to disk. It also includes code snippets for performing hyperparameter tuning using techniques such as grid search or random search.

### Evaluation
The performance of the flight prediction model can be evaluated using various metrics such as MSE, MAE and RMSE.
